## REST API

There are several end points that can be tested for each service/facade:

### Login - UI

Using login page..


### Login - REST using -u

```
curl ... -u <userEmail>:<password>
```

g.e.:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/rms-web/rest/ -u Adam@rms.com:password
```

Note: successful login result header contains new generated sessionId token that can be reused as auth token in further requests.

## Here are some examples of CURLs for each end point:
